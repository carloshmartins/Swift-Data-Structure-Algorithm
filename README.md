Algorithms can be found at:
## Cracking the Code Interview

## HackerRank

## LeetCode

## Books for Study

- Cracking The Code Interview by Gayle Laakmann Mcdowell 6th edition
- Data Structures & Algorithm in Swift by Matthijs Hollemans
- De-Coding The Technical Interview Process

This three are paid book and I really recommend to buy it, they are here for reference only, taking that into account, It will only be shown the references for the questions and its solutions. 

For example:

Questions 3.1 from Cracking The Code Interview will be -> Question 3.1. 
I won't post the question itself.

Feel free to solve and share other solutions.
If you have any questions about the solution, ask me on this repository or email me, juliaomartinsch@gmail.com
